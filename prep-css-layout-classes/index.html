        <p>After the success of the previous movie, Steven Spielberg directs the second installment in
          the Indiana Jones franchise, which is actually the prequel to the first movie. However, the Indian
          Government prevented them from shooting due to Spielberg refusing the changing of the script. Thus
          moving production to Sri Lanka and London, but also getting the film banned from India after completion.
